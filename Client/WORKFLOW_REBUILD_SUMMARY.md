## 🚀 How to Use

### Navigate to Workflows Page
```
http://localhost:3000/workflows
```

### Test Features
1. **Metrics**: View dashboard at top
2. **Search**: Type in search box
3. **Filter**: Click "Filters" button
4. **Sort**: Click column headers

6. **Actions**: Click "..." menu
7. **Tabs**: Switch between Overview/Details
8. **Create**: Click "New Workflow"
9. **AI Generate**: Click "Generate with AI"

## 📱 Responsive Breakpoints

- **Mobile** (< 768px): Single column, stacked layout
- **Tablet** (768px - 1024px): 2-column grid, compact spacing
- **Desktop** (> 1024px): Full layout, side-by-side panels
- **Large** (> 1280px): Wider content area, more whitespace

## ♿ Accessibility Features

- Semantic HTML elements
- ARIA labels on interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus indicators
- Screen reader friendly

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Backend Integration**: Some features require backend API endpoints:
   - Workflow execution endpoint
   - WebSocket streaming endpoint
   - Workflow duplication endpoint
   - Export/download endpoints

2. **Mock Data**: Currently using hook-provided data. Ensure backend matches types.

3. **Permissions**: No permission system yet. All actions available to all users.
