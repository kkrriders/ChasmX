- **Features**:
  - Filter by workflow status (active/draft)
  - Filter by execution status (success/running/error/paused/queued/idle)
  - Filter by tags
  - Active filter count badge
  - Clear all filters button
  - Responsive dropdown interface

### 4. Enhanced WorkflowListPanel
- **New Features**:
  - Advanced search by name and description
  - Multi-field sorting (name, status, updated date)
  - Integrated filter system
  - Sort order toggle (ascending/descending)
  - Enhanced workflow cards with:
    - "New" badge for recent workflows (< 24 hours)
    - Tag display (up to 2 tags + counter)
    - Better date/time formatting
    - Hover effects
  - Empty state messages context-aware
  - Better result count display

### 5. Enhanced Workflows Page
- **New Layout**:
  - Tabbed interface (Overview / Details)
  - Metrics dashboard at the top
  - Settings button for workflow configuration
  - Improved header with better typography
  - Two-column layout on details tab
  - Empty state when no workflow selected

## Key Features

### Search & Filter
- Real-time search across workflow names and descriptions

  - Tag-based filtering
- Clear visual feedback for active filters

### Sorting
- Sort by:
  - Name (A-Z, Z-A)
  - Last updated (newest/oldest first)
  - Status
- Visual indicators for sort direction
- Persistent sort state

### Metrics Dashboard
- **Active Workflows**: Count of active vs total workflows
- **Total Executions**: Total runs with current running count
- **Success Rate**: Percentage with success/total ratio
- **Average Duration**: Formatted duration display
- **Failed Executions Alert**: Prominent warning when failures detected

### Workflow Actions
All actions accessible via dropdown menu:
- Execute (only for active workflows)
- Pause (only for active workflows)
- Configure/Edit
- Duplicate
- Export JSON
- Download
- Delete (with confirmation)

### Real-time Updates
- Live execution streaming
- WebSocket connection status indicator
- Automatic polling fallback
- Real-time metrics updates

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-friendly layouts
- Collapsible sections
- Touch-optimized interactions
- Adaptive grid layouts

## Component Structure

```
app/workflows/page.tsx          # Main page with tabs and layout
components/workflows/
  ├── workflow-metrics.tsx       # Metrics dashboard
  ├── workflow-list-panel.tsx    # Enhanced workflow list
  ├── workflow-actions.tsx       # Action dropdown menu
  ├── workflow-filters.tsx       # Advanced filters
  ├── workflow-status-badge.tsx  # Status indicators
  ├── execution-history.tsx      # Execution history table
  ├── execution-details-panel.tsx# Execution details and logs
  └── ai-workflow-generator.tsx  # AI generation dialog
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```tsx
import { WorkflowsPage } from '@/app/workflows/page'

// The page handles all state management internally
<WorkflowsPage />
```

### Using Individual Components
```tsx
import { WorkflowMetrics } from '@/components/workflows/workflow-metrics'
import { WorkflowFilters } from '@/components/workflows/workflow-filters'

<WorkflowMetrics 
  workflows={workflows} 
  executions={executions}
  isLoading={false}
/>

<WorkflowFilters 
  onFilterChange={(filters) => console.log(filters)}
  showExecutionFilters={true}
/>
```

## API Integration

### Required Hooks
- `useWorkflows()` - Fetch all workflows
- `useWorkflowDetails(id)` - Fetch workflow details and executions
- `useExecutionStream(id)` - Real-time execution updates

### Expected API Responses
```typescript
// Workflow Summary
interface WorkflowSummary {
  id: string
  name: string
  status: 'active' | 'draft'
  updated_at: string
  metadata?: {
    description?: string
    tags?: string[]
    author?: string
    version?: string
  }
}

// Workflow Execution
interface WorkflowRun {
  execution_id: string
  workflow_id: string
  status: ExecutionStatus
  start_time: string
  end_time?: string
  node_states: Record<string, NodeState>
  errors: ExecutionError[]
  logs: ExecutionLogEntry[]
}
```

## Styling

All components use:
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- shadcn/ui component library
- Dark mode support
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Accessible color contrasts

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Memoization**: Heavy computations memoized with useMemo
2. **Callback Optimization**: Event handlers use useCallback
3. **Virtual Scrolling**: Long lists handled efficiently
4. **Debounced Search**: Search input debounced to reduce renders
5. **Conditional Rendering**: Components render only when needed

## Accessibility

- ARIA labels on interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly
- Focus management
- Semantic HTML structure

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Bulk workflow operations
- [ ] Export multiple workflows
- [ ] Workflow templates gallery
- [ ] Advanced workflow analytics
- [ ] Execution comparison tool
- [ ] Workflow versioning UI
- [ ] Collaboration features
- [ ] Workflow scheduling interface

## Testing

To test the rebuilt workflows feature:

1. Navigate to `/workflows`
2. Verify metrics display correctly
3. Test search functionality
4. Try different filter combinations
5. Test sorting by each field
6. Click on a workflow to view details
7. Switch between Overview and Details tabs
8. Test workflow actions menu
9. Verify real-time execution updates

## Troubleshooting

### No workflows showing
- Check API connection
- Verify authentication token
- Check browser console for errors

### Filters not working
- Clear browser cache
- Check filter state in React DevTools
- Verify filter logic in component

### Real-time updates not working
- Check WebSocket connection
- Verify backend WebSocket endpoint
- Check network tab for WS traffic

## Support

For issues or questions:
- Check the implementation guide
- Review component source code
- Test with mock data first
- Verify API responses match types
