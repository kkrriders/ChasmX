- Improved user experience
- Clean visual hierarchy

## ✅ Improvements Made

### 1. **Modern Top Header** (COMPLETED)

  - **Secondary Toolbar**: Canvas controls, view toggles, quick tools

#### Features:
- Gradient background (gray-50 to gray-100)
- Larger, more prominent workflow name input
- Visual badges showing node and connection counts

- Save/Load in a dedicated group
- Templates/Variables as quick actions
- Prominent Test and Run buttons with gradient styling

### 2. **Secondary Toolbar** (COMPLETED)
New organized control bar with:
- **Undo/Redo Group**: Compact grouped buttons with disabled states

  - Workflow Analysis
  - Comments & Notes

## ⚠️ Current Status

### Issues Encountered:
The file structure became corrupted during edits with:
1. Duplicate sections
2. Mismatched opening/closing tags
3. Multiple `<div className="flex flex-1">` sections
4. Broken JSX structure

### TypeScript Errors:
```
- JSX expressions must have one parent element (line 1075)
- ')' expected (line 2097)
- Declaration or statement expected (line 2421)
```

## 🔧 Recommended Next Steps

###Option 1: Manual Fix (Quickest)
I can provide you with a completely rewritten, clean version of the entire `builder-canvas.tsx` file with the proper structure.

### Option 2: Incremental Fix
Revert the file to the last working state and apply changes more carefully in smaller chunks.

### Option 3: Keep Current and Fix
Fix the structural issues by:
1. Removing duplicate sections
2. Properly closing all tags
3. Ensuring single parent element

## 🎨 UI Design Vision (Completed Sections)

### Color Scheme:
- **Primary**: Blue-600 to Cyan-600 gradients
- **Secondary**: Gray-50 to Gray-100 backgrounds
- **Accents**: Purple (advanced), Green (success), Red (danger)
- **Neutral**: White cards with subtle borders

### Typography:
- **Headers**: text-xl, font-semibold
- **Labels**: text-xs, font-medium
- **Buttons**: text-sm with proper spacing

### Spacing:
- **Padding**: p-6 for major sections, p-4 for cards
- **Gap**: gap-2 to gap-6 based on context
- **Heights**: Consistent h-7 to h-9 for buttons

### Component Hierarchy:
```
Main Container (h-full w-full flex flex-col)
├── Primary Header (px-6 py-4)
│   ├── Left: Branding & Workflow Name
│   └── Right: Primary Actions (Save, Load, Templates, Test, Run)
├── Secondary Toolbar (px-6 py-2)
│   ├── Left: Canvas Controls (Undo, Redo, Zoom)
│   ├── Center: View Toggles
│   └── Right: Settings & Advanced
└── Main Canvas Area (flex-1)
    ├── Left: Component Library (w-80, collapsible)
    ├── Center: React Flow Canvas
    └── Right: Properties Panel (w-96, collapsible)
```

## 💻 Technical Details

### Modern UI Patterns Used:
1. **Card-Based Layout**: White cards with borders for better organization
2. **Grouped Actions**: Related buttons in subtle background containers
3. **Icon-First Design**: Every section has a meaningful icon
4. **Gradient Accents**: Subtle gradients for visual hierarchy
5. **Consistent Sizing**: h-7, h-9 for buttons; text-xs, text-sm for labels
6. **Hover States**: Proper hover effects on all interactive elements
7. **Disabled States**: Visual feedback for unavailable actions
8. **Badge Indicators**: Show counts and status at a glance

### Component Structure:
```typescript
<Sheet> // Modal panels for Settings & Advanced
  <SheetTrigger> // Button to open
  <SheetContent> // Panel content
    <div className="border-b p-6 bg-gradient-to-r">  // Header
      <SheetHeader>
        <SheetTitle> // With icon
        <SheetDescription> // Subtitle
    <ScrollArea> // Scrollable content
      <div className="p-6 space-y-6"> // Main content
        <div className="bg-white rounded-lg border p-4"> // Card
```

## 📝 What Works vs What Needs Fix

### ✅ Working:
- New header design
- Button grouping and styling
- Settings panel structure
- Advanced panel header
- All handler functions
- All state variables

### ❌ Needs Fix:
- JSX structure (mismatched tags)
- Duplicate sections removal
- Proper component closing
- Canvas area layout
- Component Library sidebar (may be duplicated)
- Properties panel (may be duplicated)

## 🚀 Recommendation

**I recommend Option 1**: Let me provide a complete, clean rewrite of the file with:
- All the new UI improvements
- Proper structure
- No duplicates
- Working JSX
- All features intact

This will be faster than trying to fix the corrupted structure piece by piece.

Would you like me to:
1. ✅ Provide a complete clean rewrite?
2. ⚠️ Try to fix the current corrupted structure?
3. 🔄 Revert and start over with smaller changes?
