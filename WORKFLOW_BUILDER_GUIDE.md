   - The node appears with its icon and label

2. **Connect Nodes**:
   - Hover over a node to see connection handles
   - Click and drag from the right handle of one node
   - Drop on the left handle of another node
   - An animated connection line appears

3. **Configure Nodes**:
   - Click on any node to select it
   - Right sidebar shows node properties
   - Edit label, description, and settings
   - Enable/disable features as needed

4. **Save Your Work**:
   - Click "Save" in the toolbar
   - Workflow saves to browser storage
   - Use "Load" to restore later
   - Or export as JSON file

5. **Test Execution**:
   - Click "Run Workflow" button
   - Watch nodes execute in sequence
   - See status indicators update
   - Check results in overview tab

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Technologies Used:
- **React Flow** (@xyflow/react): Core canvas and node system
- **shadcn/ui**: UI component library
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling and responsive design
- **Lucide React**: Icons
- **TypeScript**: Type safety

### Key State Management:
- `nodes`: Array of workflow nodes
- `edges`: Array of connections between nodes
- `selectedNode`: Currently selected node
- `history`: Undo/redo history stack
- `isRunning`: Workflow execution state

### Custom Node Type:
```typescript
type CustomNodeData = {
  label: string
  description: string
  icon: React.ComponentType
  color: string
  category: string
  complexity: 'basic' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced'
  status?: 'success' | 'error' | 'pending'
}
```

   - Start with data sources on the left
   - Processing in the middle
   - Actions on the right
   - Keep connections logical and readable

3. **Performance**:
   - Limit workflows to 50 nodes for best performance
   - Use complexity indicators as guidance
   - Monitor estimated execution times

4. **Saving**:
   - Save frequently (Ctrl+S)
   - Export important workflows as JSON
   - Use descriptive names for exports
